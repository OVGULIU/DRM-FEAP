# DRM-FEAP
The main program, piro.for, takes as input a strip of finite elements surrounding a scatterer and defined according to the domain reduction technique (DRM)
propossed by Bielak et al (2003). The code computes effective forces consistent with a free-field motion and generates a file ready to conduct the wave
proopagation analysis with the commercial code FEAP. The repo contains and example input file (IPIRO.inp) corresponding to a V-shaped canyon
ubnder a vertically incident SV wave.
